Fire Fighting Robot 🚒🤖


An autonomous Arduino-based robot designed to detect and extinguish small fires using flame sensors, IR obstacle detection, and a water pump system. Built as part of our Industry Oriented Mini Project in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2024–2025).

📜 Project Overview
Firefighters risk their lives in hazardous situations where fires occur in inaccessible or dangerous environments. This project aims to reduce that risk by developing an autonomous fire-fighting robot that detects fire, navigates toward it, and extinguishes it using water — all without human intervention.
The system uses:
•	Flame Sensors – Detect the presence and direction of fire.
•	IR Sensors – Detect obstacles and help in navigation.
•	Arduino Uno – Processes sensor data and controls movement and fire suppression.
•	DC Motors & Motor Driver (L293D) – Enable 4-wheel drive navigation.
•	Water Pump & Relay Module – Spray water on detected flames.
•	Servo Motor – Adjusts water nozzle direction for precise targeting.

🔄 Working Principle
1.	Initialization – All components (motors, sensors, servo) are activated.
2.	Fire Detection – Flame sensors detect the fire’s direction.
3.	Navigation – Robot moves toward the fire, avoiding obstacles using IR sensors.
4.	Extinguishing – Relay activates the water pump to spray water until the fire is out.
5.	Monitoring – Continues scanning for reignition or new fire sources.
